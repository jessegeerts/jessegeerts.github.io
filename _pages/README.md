## About me
I am a PhD student at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/swc) at University College London, supervised by [Neil Burgess](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/icn/people/neil-burgess). I am interested in what kind of algorithms and representations the brain uses for navigation, learning and memory. In particular, I study the hippocampus, a brain area that contains a ''cognitive map'' of physical and abstract space. My work combines neuroscience and machine learning, focussing on how the hippocampus contains clever representations of states and uncertainty that help us learn more efficiently. 

For a very short presentation on what I have been working on recently, click [here](https://baicsworkshop.github.io/program/baics_31.html) to see my Spotlight presentation at the 2020 ICLR Bridging AI and Cognitive Science workshop. 

Before starting my PhD, I obtained undergraduate degrees in Natural Sciences and Neuroscience at the [University of Amsterdam](http://www.uva.nl/en/home) and a master's in Brain and Mind Sciences at UCL combined with [Sorbonne Université](http://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/) and [Ecole Normale Supérieure](http://www.ens.fr/) in Paris.
