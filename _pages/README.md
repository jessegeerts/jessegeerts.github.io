## About me
I am a PhD student at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/swc) at University College London, supervised by [Neil Burgess](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/icn/people/neil-burgess). I am interested in what kind of algorithms and representations the brain uses for learning, memory and navigation. In particular, I study the hippocampus, a brain area that contains a [map of physical and abstract space](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-brain-maps-out-ideas-and-memories-like-spaces-20190114/). My work combines neuroscience and machine learning and focuses on how the hippocampus contains clever representations of states and uncertainty that help us learn more efficiently. 

Before starting my PhD, I obtained undergraduate degrees in Natural Sciences and Neuroscience at the [University of Amsterdam](http://www.uva.nl/en/home) and a master's in Brain and Mind Sciences at UCL combined with [Sorbonne Université](http://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/) and [Ecole Normale Supérieure](http://www.ens.fr/) in Paris.
