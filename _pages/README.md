## About me
I am a PhD student at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/swc) at University College London, supervised by [Neil Burgess](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/icn/people/neil-burgess). I am interested in the problem of learning in both real brains and artificial systems. For my PhD project, I investigate this in the context of spatial representations in hippocampus and their relationship to reinforcement learning. 

Before starting my PhD, I have done rotation projects with [Adam Kampff](http://www.kampff-lab.org), [Maneesh Sahani](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~maneesh/) and [Zhaoping Li](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/zhaoping.li/). Before that, I obtained undergraduate degrees in Natural Sciences and Neuroscience at the [University of Amsterdam](http://www.uva.nl/en/home) and a master's in Brain and Mind Sciences at UCL combined with [Sorbonne Université](http://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/) and [Ecole Normale Supérieure](http://www.ens.fr/) in Paris.
