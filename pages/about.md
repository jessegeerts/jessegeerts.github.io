Computational cognitive neuroscientist and AI researcher, studying learning in brains, minds and machines. I'm currently a Research Fellow at the [computational neuroscience lab](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/groups/clopath-lab) at Imperial. My research focuses on learning and memory, and I study this by comparing behavioural and neural data to computational simulations.

Before joining Imperial, I did my PhD in the [space & memory lab](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/icn/research/research-groups/space-memory) at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre at UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/swc). I wrote my dissertation about how flexible Reinforcement Learning strategies can explain contextual decision making and hippocampal neural activations. Find my CV [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/JesseGeertsCV.pdf).
