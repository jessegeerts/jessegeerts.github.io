Computational cognitive neuroscientist and AI researcher. I'm currently a Research Fellow at the [computational neuroscience lab](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/groups/clopath-lab) at Imperial, studying learning in brains, minds and machines. My current research direction focuses on mechanistic interpretability and the generalization properties of neural network models. More generally, I am interested in how artificial and biological neural networks can achieve generalization from limited experience.

Before joining Imperial, I did my PhD in the [space & memory lab](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/icn/research/research-groups/space-memory) at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre at UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/swc). I wrote my dissertation about how flexible Reinforcement Learning strategies can explain contextual decision making and hippocampal neural activations. Find my CV [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/JesseGeertsCV.pdf).
